# VAX: Data collection tool for integrating multiple sensing modalities

**About:** This tool is used to integrate wide variety of sensors to collect timestamped data in one single framework. The framework provides a driver interface to read, write and visualize data in realtime. This framework is tested with 7 different sensing modalities connected in parallel with an Ubuntu 22.04 system (Intel NUC).
