# VAX: Data Collection and Data Annotation


**About:** This module presents code for running data collection from audio, video (for A/V pipeline), and four privacy preserving
sensors (Doppler, Lidar, ThermalCam, Micarray). It also consists of a data annotation tool, which can run in parallel to
data collection process to mark ground truth for instances in real time.

## 1. Workbench Setup

To collect data from A/V and privacy-sensitive sensors, we need corresponding sensor
hardware along with connectors (either USB or Ethernet Cables). Based on amount of sensors you wish to collect data
from, We might need power extension, Ethernet switches etc.

### Environment Setup:

### a. Clone (or Fork!) this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/synergylabs/vax.git
cd vax/data_collection_annotation
```

### b. Create a virtual environment and install python packages

We recommend using conda. Tested on `Ubuntu 22.04`, with `python 3.9`.

```bash
conda create -n "vax_data_collection" python=3.9
conda activate vax_data_collection
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
